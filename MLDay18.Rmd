There is no simple rule for determining the edibility of a [mushroom](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bgreenwell/MLDay18/master/data/mushroom.csv); no rules like **"leaflets three, let it be"**, **"hairy vine, no friend of mine"** and **"berries white, run in fright"** for poison ivy.

# Predicting email spam

.pull-left[

- Data from 4601 email messages collected at Hewlett-Packard Labs

- **Goal:** predict whether an email message is <span style="color:Tomato">spam</span> (junk email) or <span style="color:MediumSeaGreen ">ham</span> (good email)

- **Features:** relative frequencies in a message of 57 of the most commonly occurring words and punctuation marks in all the training the email messages

- For this problem, not all errors are equal; misclassifying <span style="color:Tomato">spam</span> is not as bad as misclassifying <span style="color:MediumSeaGreen">ham</span>!

## Creating ensembles of trees

- Bagging (simplest and has **zero tuning parameters!** `r emo::ji("sunglasses")`)

- Random forest (a slight modification over bagged decision trees)

- Boosting (can be more accurate, but **lots of tuning parameters!** `r emo::ji("scream")`)

# Background

* **Bagging on steroids!!**

* Grow trees just as in bagging, but with a small twist

    - At each split in each tree in the forest, select a subset of the predictors as candidate splitters
    
      - This essentially **"decorrelates" the trees!**
    
    - The number of randomly selected variables, denoted $m_{try}$, is a **tuning parameter** (really the only tuning parameter in a random forest)

* Bagging introduces randomness into the rows of the data

* Random forests introduce randomness into the rows and columns of the data

# Out-of-bag data

* For large enough $N$, on average, $1 - e^{-1} \approx 63.21$% or the original records end up in any bootstrap sample

* Thus, roughly $e^{-1} \approx 36.79$% of the original observations are not used in the construction of a particular tree

* These observations are considered *out-of-bag* (OOB) and can be usd to

    - Provide an unbiased error estimates (**sort of an unstructured, but free, cross-validation**)
 
    - Construct a novel variable importance measure based on the **predictive strength** of each feature!!

# OOB-based variable importance

* **Traditional approach:** Average variable importance scores (i.e., total goodness of split) over all trees 

* **Novel approach:** To estimate the importance of the $k$-th variable ($x_k$):

  1. Record the OOB performance of the model
  
  2. Randomly permute all the values of $x_k$ in the OOB data
  
  3. Recompute the OOB performance of the model
  
  4. The difference between the two OOB performance measures the strength of the structural importance of $x_k$
  
* Fundamentally different as these importance scores are **NOT** based on data seen by the individual trees!

# Boston housing example

* Housing data from $N = 506$ census tracts in the city of Boston for the year 1970

* Nowadays, many supervised learning algorithms can fit the data automatically in seconds---typically with higher accuracy!

# Partial dependence plots

* Constructing a PDP in practice is rather straightforward!! `r emo::ji("sunglasses")`

* Let $x_1$ be the predictor variable of interest with unique values $\left\{x_{11}, x_{12}, \dots, x_{1k}\right\}$

* The partial dependence of the response on $x_1$ can be constructed as follows:

    1. For $i \in \left\{1, 2, \dots, k\right\}$:
    
        a. Copy the training data and replace the original values of $x_1$ with the constant $x_{1i}$
    
        b. Compute the vector of predicted values from the modified copy of the training data
        
        c. Compute the average prediction to obtain $\bar{f}_1\left(x_{1i}\right)$

    2. Plot the pairs $\left\{x_{1i}, \bar{f}_1\left(x_{1i}\right)\right\}$ for $i = 1, 2, \dotsc, k$

# Partial dependence plots: `pdp`

.pull-left[

* Not all RF implementations provide support for constructing PDPs

* The `pdp` package:

    - Provides a consistent way of constructing PDPs (and more) from many types of ML models (not just RFs)

    - Allows for multivariate displays (i.e., interactions) and so much more!!

# Proximity matrix

* One of the most useful tools provided by random forests

* In random forests (and bagging), **trees are intentionally grown deep**!

    1. Initialize the proximity between cases $i$ and $j$ to zero: $prox_{ij} = 0$

    2. After a tree is grown, put all of the data, both training and OOB, down the tree

    3. If cases $i$ and $j$ land in the same terminal node, increase $prox_{ij}$ by one

    4. At the end, normalize $prox_{ij}$ by dividing by the number of trees in the forest

* The pairwise proximities can be used to construct a useful distance matrix

* **Requires the storage of an $N \times N$ matrix!!** `r emo::ji("scream")`

# Missing value imputation

* Random forest offers a novel approach to imputing missing values (i.e., `NA`s)

    1. Start with cheap imputation (e.g., median for continuous features)
    
    2. Run a random forest and obtain the proximity matrix
    
    3. Imputed values are updated using:
    
        - The weighted average of the non-missing observations, where the weights are the proximity (**continuous**)
        
        - The category with the largest average proximity (**categorical**)

    4. Iterate this procedure until convergence (~ 4-6 times seems sufficient)

* Highly computational (requires many random forest runs!!)

* Resulting **OOB error estimate tends to be overly optimistic**

# Boosting

???

Image credit: [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Forest#/media/File:Fog_forrest_frickberg.jpg)


---

# Background

* Boosting is a general technique to create an ensemble of models (*meta-algorithm*)

* In contrast to bagging, boosting:

    - uses a *weak learner* for each model
    
    - builds the models sequentially (fix past mistakes)
    
* Most commonly used with decision trees (e.g., *decision stumps*), but other types of models can be boosted

* Boosting requires more tuning, but is typically faster and more accurate than RFs!

* Many variants: AdaBoost, gradient boosting, and stochastic gradient boosting (GBM), for example


---

# Stochastic gradient boosting

* Stochastic gradient boosting is the most general and widely used

* Allows for arbitrary differentiable loss functions (**generalized**)

* Introduces subsampling into the rows and columns (**stochastic**)

* Loss function is optimized using *gradient descent* (**gradient**)

* With the right combination of parameters, GBMs can emulate RFs!

* Popular R package for boosting: `gbm`, `gbm3`, `xgboost`, and `lightgbm`

* Check out the [machine learning task view](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/MachineLearning.html)!


---

# Lots of tuning parameters

* Size of trees (controls interaction depth)

* Learning rate (shrinkage for regularization)

* Number of trees

* Minimum leaf size

* Subsampling fraction

* **And many more depending on the implementation!** (ya, I'm talking about you, `xgboost` `r emo::ji("smug")`)


---

# Essential algorithm

* Iteratively learning a set of weak models on subsets of the data

* Weighing each weak prediction according to each weak learner's performance

* Combine the weighted predictions to obtain a single weighted prediction

$$F_m\left(x\right) = F_{m - 1}\left(x\right) + v \times\gamma_m h_m\left(x\right), \quad 0 < v \le 1$$

# GBM packages in R

* `gbm`: **g**eneralized **b**oosted **m**odels

    - The original R implementation of GMBs (by Greg Ridgeway)
    
    - Slower than modem implementations (but still pretty fast)
    
    - Currently orphaned on CRAN (for now)
    
* `gbm3`: **g**eneralized **b**oosted **m**odels 

    - Shiny new version of `gbm` that is not backwards compatible
    
    - Faster and supports parallel tree building
    
    - Not currently listed on CRAN

* `xgboost`: R interface to XGBoost for <span style="color:DeepSkyBlue">eXtreme Gradient Boosting</span>

* `lightgbm`: Microsoft supported **?**competitor to `xgboost`**?**

* `mboost`: **m**odel-based **boost**ing


---

# Missing values

* Unlike RFs, GBMs typically support missing values!

* In most GBM implementations, `NA`s are interpreted as containing information (i.e., missing for a reason), rather than missing at random

    - In `gbm` and `gbm3`, a separate branch is created at each split for `NA`s (i.e., each decision node contains three splits: left, right, and missing)
    
    - In `h2o` and `xgboost` each split has a **default direction** that is learned during training (`NA`s take the default route!)

# GBMs and PDPs

* PDPs can be slow to construct using the brute force method (**it involves making multiple copies of the training data!!**)
    
* The exception is decision trees based on single-variable splits which can make use of the efficient *weighted tree traversal method* described in Friedman (2001)

    - However, only the `gbm` and `gbm3` packages utilize this approach 

    - The `pdp` package:

        - Also exploits this strategy when used with `gbm` models

        - Has the option to construct PDPs in parallel using any parallel back end supported by the `foreach` package

        - Allows for user specified grids (e.g., plotting over the deciles of a feature is much faster and often sufficient to reveal functional relationships!)
