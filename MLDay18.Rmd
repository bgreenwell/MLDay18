## Predicting email spam

.pull-left[

- Data from 4601 email messages collected at Hewlett-Packard Labs

- **Goal:** predict whether an email message is <span style="color:Tomato">spam</span> (junk email) or <span style="color:MediumSeaGreen ">ham</span> (good email)

- **Features:** relative frequencies in a message of 57 of the most commonly occurring words and punctuation marks in all the training the email messages

- For this problem, not all errors are equal; misclassifying <span style="color:Tomato">spam</span> is not as bad as misclassifying <span style="color:MediumSeaGreen">ham</span>!

## Creating ensembles of trees

* The key to accuracy is **low bias** and **low variance**

* **Main idea:** breaking the [*bias-variance trade-off*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias%E2%80%93variance_tradeoff)

    - $Error \approx Bias + Variance$

* Two popular algorithms (can be applied to any model, **not just trees!**):

    - Bagging (<span style="color:Magenta">reduce variance by averaging</span>)

    - Boosting (<span style="color:Magenta">reduce bias by building models sequentially</span>)
    
* Random forest is just a slight modification over bagging applied to decision trees!

* **B**ootstrap **agg**regat**ing**

* Bagging trees:

    1. Sample records **with replacement** (i.e., bootstrap the training data)
    
    2. Fit an **overgrown tree** to the resampled data set
    
    3. Repeat a large number of times ( $\ge 500$ , say)

* Same idea as ["wisdom of the crowd"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_of_the_crowd) (<span style="color:purple">Francis Galton's Ox weight survey</span>)

* Improves the stability and accuracy of noisy models (e.g., individual trees)

# Random forest

---

## Background

* **Bagging on steroids!!**

* Correlation limits the effect of bagging!

* Grow trees just as in bagging, but with a small twist

    - Before each split in each tree in the forest, select a subset of the predictors **at random** as candidate splitters
    
      - This essentially **"decorrelates"** the trees in the ensemble!
    
    - The number of randomly selected variables, denoted $m_{try}$, is a **tuning parameter** (arguably the only tuning parameter in a random forest)

* Bagging introduces <span style="color:CornFlowerBlue">randomness into the rows</span> of the data

* Random forest introduces <span style="color:CornFlowerBlue">randomness into the rows and columns</span> of the data

* [*Extremely randomized trees*](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10994-006-6226-1) take this randomness one step further to reduce variance!

```

]


---

## Out-of-bag data

* For large enough $N$, on average, $1 - e^{-1} \approx 63.21$% or the original records end up in any bootstrap sample

```{r bootstrap}
N <- 100000
set.seed(1537)  # for reproducibility
x <- rnorm(N)
mean(x %in% sample(x, replace = TRUE))  # non-OOB proportion
```

* Thus, roughly $e^{-1} \approx 36.79$% of the original observations are not used in the construction of a particular tree

* These observations are considered *out-of-bag* (OOB) and can be used to

    - Construct novel variable importance measure based on the **predictive strength** of each predictor!!

## OOB-based variable importance

* **Traditional approach:** Average variable importance scores (i.e., total goodness of split) over all the trees in the ensemble (this is what is done for GBMs)

* **Novel approach:** To estimate the importance of the $k$-th variable, $x_k$:

  1. Record the OOB performance of the model
  
  2. Randomly permute all the values of $x_k$ in the OOB data
  
  3. Recompute the OOB performance of the model
  
  4. The difference between the two OOB performance measures the strength of the structural importance of $x_k$
  
* Fundamentally different as these importance scores are **NOT** based on data seen by the individual trees!

* Nowadays, many supervised learning algorithms can fit the data automatically in seconds (**typically with higher accuracy!**)

* The downfall, however, is some loss of interpretation since these algorithms typically do not produce simple prediction formulas (**but there's still hope!** `r emo::ji("pray")`)

## Partial dependence plots

.scrollable[

* [Partial dependence plots (PDPs)](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2017/RJ-2017-016/index.html) help visualize the relationship between a subset of the features (typically 1-3) and the response

* Let $x_1$ be the predictor variable of interest with unique values $\left\{x_{11}, x_{12}, \dots, x_{1k}\right\}$

* The partial dependence of the response on $x_1$ can be constructed as follows:

    1. For $i \in \left\{1, 2, \dots, k\right\}$:
    
        a. Copy the training data and replace the original values of $x_1$ with the constant $x_{1i}$
    
        b. Compute the vector of predicted values from the modified copy of the training data
        
        c. Compute the average prediction to obtain $\bar{f}_1\left(x_{1i}\right)$

    2. Plot the pairs $\left\{x_{1i}, \bar{f}_1\left(x_{1i}\right)\right\}$ for $i = 1, 2, \dotsc, k$

## Proximity matrix

* In random forests (and bagging), **trees are intentionally grown deep**!

    1. Initialize the proximity between cases $i$ and $j$ to zero: $prox_{ij} = 0$

    2. After a tree is grown, put all of the data, both training and OOB, down the tree

    3. If cases $i$ and $j$ land in the same terminal node, increase $prox_{ij}$ by one

    4. At the end, normalize $prox_{ij}$ by dividing by the number of trees in the forest

* The pairwise proximities can be used to construct a useful distance matrix

* **Requires the storage of an $N \times N$ matrix!!** `r emo::ji("scream")`

* Only available in [`randomForest`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=randomForest), [`party`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/party/index.html), and [`bigrf`](https://github.com/aloysius-lim/bigrf)

## Missing value imputation

* Random forest offers a novel approach to imputing missing values (i.e., `NA`s)

    1. Start with cheap imputation (e.g., median for continuous features)
    
    2. Run a random forest and obtain the proximity matrix
    
    3. Imputed values are updated using:
    
        - The weighted average of the non-missing observations, where the weights are the proximity (**continuous**)
        
        - The category with the largest average proximity (**categorical**)

    4. Iterate this procedure until convergence (~ 4-6 times seems sufficient)

* Highly computational (requires many random forest runs!!)

* Resulting **OOB error estimate tends to be overly optimistic** 

* Only available in [`randomForest`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=randomForest)

# Boosting

???

Image credit: [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Forest#/media/File:Fog_forrest_frickberg.jpg)


---

## Background

.scrollable[

* Boosting is a general technique for creating an ensemble of models (*meta-algorithm*)

* In contrast to bagging, boosting:

    - Uses a *weak learner* for the base learners
    
    - Builds the models sequentially (fix past mistakes)
    
* Most commonly used with **shallow decision trees** (e.g., decision stumps), but other types of models can be boosted

* **Boosting requires more tuning**, but is typically faster and more accurate than RFs!

* **Many flavors of boosting:** AdaBoost, Real AdaBoost, gradient boosting, and stochastic gradient boosting (GBM), for example

* GBMs are the most **general** and widely used flavor of boosting

    - Introduces subsampling into the rows and columns (**stochastic**)

    - Loss function is optimized using *gradient descent* (**gradient**)

    - With the right combination of parameters, GBMs can emulate RFs!

]

## GBMs with squared-error loss

1. Given a training sample $\boldsymbol{d} = \left(\boldsymbol{X}, \boldsymbol{y}\right)$. Fix the number of steps $B$, the shrinkage factor $\epsilon$, and the tree depth $d$. Set the initial fit $\widehat{G}_0 \equiv 0$, and the residual vector $\boldsymbol{r} = \boldsymbol{y}$.

2. For $b = 1, 2, \dots, B$ repeat:

    a) Fit a regression tree $\tilde{g}_b$ to the data $\left(\boldsymbol{X}, \boldsymbol{r}\right)$, grown best-first to depth $d$
    
    b) Update the fitted model with a shrunken version of $\tilde{g}_b$: $\widehat{G}_b = \widehat{G}_{b - 1} + \epsilon \tilde{g}_b$
    
    c) Update the residuals accordingly: $r_i = r_i - \epsilon \tilde{g}_b$, $i = 1, 2, \dots, n$
    
3. Return the sequence of fitted functions $\widehat{G}_b$, $b = 1, 2, \dots, B$.

* Here, $B$, $\epsilon$, and $d$ are tuning parameters

## GBM packages in R

.scrollable[

* [`gbm`](https://github.com/gbm-developers/gbm): **g**eneralized **b**oosted **m**odels

    - The original R implementation of GMBs (by Greg Ridgeway)
    
    - Slower than modem implementations (but still pretty fast)
    
    - Provides OOB error estimate
    
    - Supports the *weighted tree traversal* method for fast construction of PDPs
    
    - Currently orphaned on CRAN (for now)
    
* [`gbm3`](https://github.com/gbm-developers/gbm3): **g**eneralized **b**oosted **m**odels

    - Shiny new version of `gbm` that is not backwards compatible
    
    - Faster and supports parallel tree building
    
    - Not currently listed on CRAN
    
* [`xgboost`](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost): <span style="color:DeepSkyBlue">eXtreme Gradient Boosting</span>

    - Widely used by data scientists to achieve **state-of-the-art** results across many machine learning challenges (e.g., Kaggle)

    - Designed to be highly efficient, flexible, and portable
    
    - Supports user-defined loss functions
    
    - Supports early stopping
    
    - Includes fast histogram method for numeric features
    
    - Parallel tree boosting and GPU support!!

```{r gpu, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/gpu.jpg")
```


* [`lightgbm`](https://github.com/Microsoft/LightGBM):  

    - Microsoft supported, and somewhat [faster](https://github.com/Microsoft/LightGBM/blob/master/docs/Experiments.rst#comparison-experiment), alternative to `xgboost`

    - Uses *leaf-wise* (i.e., best-first) tree growth
    
    - Not currently listed on CRAN

* [`mboost`](https://github.com/boost-R): **m**odel-based **boost**ing

    - Implements tools for fitting and evaluating a variety of regression and classification models (somewhere between GLMs/GAMs and GBMs)

]


---

## Missing values

* Unlike RFs, GBMs typically support missing values!

* In most GBM implementations, `NA`s are interpreted as containing information (i.e., missing for a reason), rather than missing at random

    - In [`gbm`](https://github.com/gbm-developers/gbm) and [`gbm3`](https://github.com/gbm-developers/gbm3), a separate branch is created at each split for `NA`s (i.e., each decision node contains three splits: left, right, and missing)
    
    - In [`h2o`](https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/tree/master/h2o-r) and [`xgboost`](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost) each split has a **default direction** that is learned during training (`NA`s take the default route!)
